To compile this code and play it yourself is to have a compiler with you (like clang++, or g++).

# g++
```
g++ -std=c++20 -o /*whatever name u want*/ main.c++
```

# clang++
```
g++ -std=c++20 -o /*whatever name u want*/ main.c++
```

make sure each compiler supports C++20, as the library I use in my code requires C++20 support.

and... thats all.




*bye!*
